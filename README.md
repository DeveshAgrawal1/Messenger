# Messenger
This app is a GUI based messenger through which one can send mails (currently configured for gmail) and text messages to their phones.
It uses wxPython for the GUI functionality.

To send SMS, you have to get an account id, token and a phone number from the Twilio website. You can get it by just creating an account there. 
After getting it, just update your details in the mess.py file.
To send mails, there is no need for any registration.

For running the app, just keep all the files in the same folder and run gui.py. Enjoy!
